## PROJECT DBG
I have decided to create dbg in order to help me debug my code during runtime.
You might think you wrote the better code but that does not mean it does not have flaws.
Sometimes you want to see how data is flowing from variable to variable and from one function to the other and one way to inspect your program at runtime is through debugging.

### NOTE!!
I am using this tool for my own purposes, but I will provide a documentation for dbg once am done, :).
